# Translalia Web Docs (Local)

## What this file is for
Explains the role of the small `translalia-web/docs/` set after documentation restructuring.

## When to read/use this
- Read when looking for app-specific LLM working notes.
- Use root docs for canonical project documentation.

## Canonical Documentation
Primary project documentation lives at:
- `docs/INDEX.md`
- `docs/05-llm/DOC_MAP.md`

## Local Working Docs Kept Here
- `LLM_CONTEXT.md` (legacy deep reference, deprecated as primary source)
- `PROMPTS.md`
- `TRANSLATION_PIPELINE.md`

These are retained as focused working references for translation/LLM workflows.
