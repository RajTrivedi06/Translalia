# Frontend Rules

## What this file is for
Rules and conventions for frontend development in `translalia-web/`.

## When to read/use this
Use this when working on UI, client state, routes, or frontend APIs.

## Frontend Stack
- Framework: Next.js App Router.
- UI: React components in `translalia-web/src/components/`.
- State/data: Placeholder for state and query conventions.

## Component Conventions
- Keep components focused and reusable.
- Prefer composition over deep prop chains.

## File Structure
- Keep route code in `src/app/`.
- Keep shared utilities in `src/lib/`.

## Best Practices
- Keep async/error states explicit in UI.
- Add tests or verification steps for non-trivial behavior.
