# Backend Rules

## What this file is for
Rules for backend services, API handlers, and server-side logic.

## When to read/use this
Use when editing backend endpoints, services, or integrations.

## Backend Stack
- Placeholder for backend framework and runtime standards.

## Code Organization
- Keep transport, domain logic, and data access separated where practical.

## API Conventions
- Define request/response contracts clearly.
- Document auth and error behavior.

## Error Handling
- Return consistent error structures.
- Avoid leaking internal details in responses.
