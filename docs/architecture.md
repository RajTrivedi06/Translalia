# Architecture Summary

## What this file is for
Short narrative overview of architecture decisions and system boundaries.

## When to read/use this
- Read for quick architectural orientation.
- Use before deep-diving into detailed architecture docs.

## Canonical Detail
- Primary architecture docs live in:
  - `docs/01-architecture/system-overview.md`
  - `docs/01-architecture/data-flow.md`

This file is a high-level landing page and should stay short.
